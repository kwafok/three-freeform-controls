<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r123/three.min.js"></script>

## Basic Usage

Given a three.js camera, scene, and renderer:

```js
const controlsManager = new FreeformControls.ControlsManager(
  camera,
  renderer.domElement
);
scene.add(controlsManager);
```

Now anchoring the controls on a three.js object:

```js
// box is of type THREE.Object3D
// box can thus be a THREE.Mesh or a THREE.Group for a group of objects
const controls = controlsManager.anchor(box);
```
